 * Alchemist's shop has shelves full of magic potions. Many of the potions are the same so there is no need to create
 * a new object for each of them.
 * Instead, one object instance can represent multiple shelf items so the memory footprint remains small.
 *
 * In Short: It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

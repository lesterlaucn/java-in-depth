 * Imagine a tower where the local wizards go to study their spells. The ivory tower can only be accessed through a proxy
 * which ensures that only the first three wizards can enter. Here the proxy represents the functionality of the tower and adds access control to it.
 *
 *
 * Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.
